test notes
-difrences between hardware and software-examples
-3 types of computers-pc(desktop),workstations,and mainframes
-primary memory(phisical ram(random access memory)) secondary memory(hardisk or floppy)
-input(keybord)&output
-operating system-housekeeper-recognises (keyboard) commands
-bits and bytes
-cpu(what it does?) consists of two other parts-
-phases of language-see and lern generations
-steps for compilation-(what and how is created)
-source code (cpp)is sometimes called source
-intergrated developement enviroment
-purpose and difrence between include statement and linker,linking statement,linked libraries
-obj=object code
-algorythm
-software life cycle-the big payoff is in the front
-signify comments-
-mathmatical symbols
-assignment vs eqality
-esplane asinement
-kno what qote do-called string literal-/n=new line
-C++ ingores white space
-must have paired curly brackets
-; terminates a statement
-{}-function terminator
-int- data type,type identifier
-main-name of the function-C++ must have a function named main
-name uses what inside ()s
-C++ works from innermost function out
-functions inside of function-nesting
-two kinds of errors- fatal-chokes program,compiler or syntax. logic- lets it go,warns
*do not compile with warnings
-programs statement can go on same line as comment,but must come first/leftmost
-steams-any lengths of characters
-include files are recognised by C++ by<>s
-CSM-HOUSEKEEPING BORLAND THING
