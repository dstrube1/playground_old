SWFAddress 1.1 

Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
SWFAddress provides deep linking for Flash websites and applications. In 
other words it enables the Back, Forward and Reload buttons of the 
browser and creates unique URLs with page titles that can be sent over 
email or IM. SWFAddress also comes with a technique that enables search
engine indexing for deep Flash links. It supports the following browsers:

Mozilla Firefox 1+
Internet Explorer 6+
Safari 1.3+
Opera 9.02+
Camino 1+
Mozilla 1.8+
Netscape 8+


Dependencies
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
SWFObject 1.5 - http://blog.deconcept.com


Running the samples
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Flash and SEO samples require Flash 8+
The MTASC sample requires MTASC 1.11+
The Flex sample requires Flex 2 SDK

The SEO sample contains appropriate files that can be served by Apache 
1.33+, PHP 4+ with mod_rewrite or Tomcat 5+ with UrlRewrite 2.6.


Notes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The AS1 version of SWFAddress requires AS2 mode for the Flash FLA
file because of the ExternalInterface functionality. Pure AS1 version is 
possible in future releases that may use an alternative Flash/JS bridge.

The swfaddress.html file located next to the swfaddress.js is required 
for Internet Explorer. It should accompany the JS class if you 
reorganize the folder structure.

The SEO support requires a trailing slash at the end of the address 
value. For example '/portfolio/' should be used instead of '/portfolio'. 

The SEO sample comes with files needed for every supported environment. 
The unneeded files can be deleted. For example, index.jsp and 
urlrewrite.xml are not needed for PHP and mod_rewrite setup. If 
UrlRewrite is used, then urlrewrite.xml should be moved to the WEB-INF 
folder.

If you want to utilize one of the ActionScript classes in a package 
structure use the com.asual.swfaddress.SWFAddress naming.


Known issues
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Back/Forward popup menu does not display page titles correcly.

Opera reloads the Flash movies when you navigate using the browser 
buttons.

SWFAddress values should not match the naming of frame labels on the main 
timeline.

Usage of getURL together with SWFAddress/ExternalInterface often breaks
the content in Internet Explorer 6.

The setStatus() and related methods are not supported on Safari and 
does not work with the default settings of Firefox and IE7.

Manual editing of anchors in Mozilla based browsers breaks location bar 
updates.
