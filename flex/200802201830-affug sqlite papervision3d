SQL Lite:
tools: http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/wiki?p=ManagementTools; sqlite admin- AIR; firefox plugin: SQLite Manager;  SQLite2008 Pro
manipulating data: connect to db, create/deploy tables; CRUDs; manip results
	connect: 
	myConn = new SQLConnection();
	dbFile = File.applicationStorageDirectory.resolvePath(filename);
	conn.open(dbFile);
	conn.openAsync(dbFile);
	create tables:
	sql="create table if not exists "+tablename+" (ID INTEGERPRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT/, " + ...//SQLite Mgr makes this easy
	CRUD:
	var sql:String = "Select * from "+tableName;
	selectStmt = new SQLStatement();
	selectStmt.sqlConnection = conn;
	selectStmt.execute(); //=commit unless specify begin transaction
	...
	manip results:
	var aResult:Array = selectStmt.getResult().data;
	var result:ArrayCollection = new ArrayCollection(aResult);
	...
	
	
strategy for data synching
self-contained- very portable
serverless- no isolation
zero config, transactional, public domain, utf-8&16
file format is cross platform- replacement for fopen()
compact lib: 250K 
no stored procs; no enforcing of data type constraints (can put strings into ints +vv); no foriegn key constraints (can use triggers, but nothing built in); primary keys must be integers (can have additional columns that indexed with uniqueness; no UUIDs)- problem: predictability
is not: for client server apps ("doesn't work over network connection"); high volume; very large datasets (100MB, ok); high concurrency (is single user app)
manifest typing instead of typed columns
can perform ops synchronously or asynchronously
used in AIR, Apple Mail, Safari, Firefox 3 bookmarking, Google desktop for mac, Android OS
