Where to start. How does one describe liz is like asking how to describe everything- that what she is to me.
I love her. We met in my second failed attempt at Calc 2. And now everyday my heart is full and glad to have her in my life; her precense is heaven. She makes me very happy.
I really could ramble on about this forever, but you probly get the idea well enuf.
