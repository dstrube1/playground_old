ive that a couple times and got an automated email saying that i'd have to post a request on the forum. (attached is the email)
forum searches dont seem to be entirely reliable or efficient.

i certainly do appreciate your patience and prompt response - its nice to see some companies get back to their people in such a timely manner.

respectfully

-ps - sorry for accidentally replying to this first from my other email address- didnt mean to be confusing or anything :-p
