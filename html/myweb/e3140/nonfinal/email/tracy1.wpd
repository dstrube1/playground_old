Tracy,

Here are the answers:

(1).  Software installations are done by primarily by Software, but =
Service can reinstall software, and Hardware installs images on new =
systems based on Software Section recommendations.  Networking installs =
server software on their servers.  Yes, it can depend on the software.
=20
(2).  It depends on the operation environment NetWare, NT, Unix.  Each has =
their own way of performing automated software installs.  Microsoft =
handles this using global and local policies with Windows 2000 Active =
Directory Server.  Novell (NetWare) has similar capabilities using =
Zenworks.  I and not sure how Unix servers would/could do this.  There are =
different identifiers that could be used.  Login name, workstation id, MAC =
address, it all depends on the operating system.
We have done any specific cost analysis.  If you stop and consider how =
long it could take one technical to reinstall software for one user =
manually as opposed to some automated method the cost is substantial.
Yes, it is possible to perform an automatic (non-manual) install from the =
network to a specific room.

If a more technical response is needed please let me know.

Tony,=20

One of my student assistants are working on presentation for a technical =
writing class.=20
He asked the following questions:=20

Who does the software installations? software dept or networking?=20
does it depend on the software?=20

How is it done?=20
specifically, how is an automatic installation of an application across a =
network from a single installing exe done?=20
imagine each computer having the software installed on it would require a =
user name (which may be repeated on all computers) and a unique location =
identifier (ex, the computr login/workstation number, e.g., BB46620). how =
would that be done?=20
is there ever any calculation done for the cost of a sucessful installation=
? for an unsuccessful installation?=20
is it possible to perform an automatic (non-manual) network install to a =
particular room?=20

Tony, he would like to have the answers by 5pm Tuesday night if possible =
can you help him out?.=20
Thanks=20
Tracy=20
