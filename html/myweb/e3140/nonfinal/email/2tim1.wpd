Subject: RE: mass installer

dear tim, 
no problemo- somethings are worth a bit of trouble.

in fact its good that this is progressing at a meticulous pace due to the complexity of this situation.
the proposal to my campus entails that the software be installed around campus incrementally- in batches of around 30- some as many as 50, some as few as 8. the incremental installation will take place in rooms around campus (preferably by remote automatic means) to a total of about 350 computers from july 2002 till february 2003. after the software has proven itself to the powers that be, as many as 2700 other computers will have the software installed on them in the final phase of the plan; but the number may be as low as 1000- the timetable doesnt require the number for the final phase to be decided on till the end of January.

another twist to my story is that i dont know all the details about the campus' firewall or proxy server specs. i do kno the software can be installed on an individual basisc no problem. i was really just hoping for either 
a- a simple all purpose mass installer or 
b- a contact to give to the powers that be, should they decide to go forward with my proposal.

option a is impossible (yes?); so, even tho b may be unlikely, may i assume that you are the contact person whose email address i can deliver along with my proposal?

any idea why none of my previous installer requests were recieved?

i greatly appreciate your help.

respectfully,
