i'm putting together a proposal to my campus for installing the software on the majority of our 3100 computers, and so far, ive gotten a lot of positive feedback on the idea. actually having a mass installer to give to the ssoftware dept (or having the name of someone who can give the installer to the software dept) would really help my case. 

also, what this ive been hearing about the cancer project ending in april? is this true? if so, what will the next prject be? if its true, i'd need to edit my proposal a little; i hope its something still biotech oriented- otherwise, i'd have to edit my proposal alot; selling something non-biotech may be a bit harder.
