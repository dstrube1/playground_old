Dear Dr. Reggio,
	In the interest of network and PC security and safety, this email is to inform you that (for reasons of formatting) I will be sending you an email shortly with a MS Word attachment. To the best of my knowledge, this attachment does not contain a virus or intentionally harmful macro. If your email client doesn't accept MS Word attachments, please let me know and I will make this letter temporarily available via the web (or simply give you a printed version).

Thank you
David Strube
