My name is David Russell and my major is computer science. I am doing a report for English 3140. For my report, I need the number (as accurate as possible) of all computers on the KSU campus (including the Continuing Education facility, and faculty and staff computers) that run on a MS operating system, particularly Windows 98, ME, NT 4.0 (SP5+), 2000, and XP. Your assistance in this matter would be greatly appreciated. I would also like to know if I may be allowed to cite you as the source of this information in my report. Thanks.
