Subject: question about software installation on the network

how is it done?
specifically, how is an automatic installation of an application across a network from a single installing exe done?
imagine each computer having the software installed on it would require a user name (which may be repeated on all computers) and a unique location identifier (ex, the computr login/workstation number, e.g., BB46620). how would that be done?
is there ever any calculation done for the cost of a sucessful installation? for an unsuccessful installation?
is it possible to perform an automatic (non-manual) network install to a particular room?
how does the software installations? software dept or networking?
does it depend on the software?
