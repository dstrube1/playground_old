Subject: inquiry for the tally of computers on campus
Status: RO

My name is David Russell and my major is computer science. I am doing a report for English 3140. For my report, I would like to have an figure (as accurate as possible) of the number of all computers on the KSU campus (including the Continuing Education facility, and faculty and staff computers) that run on a MS operating system, particularly Windows 98, ME, NT 4.0 (SP5+), 2000, and XP. Your assistance in this matter would be greatly appreciated. I would also like to know if I may be allowed to cite you as the source of this information in my report. Thanks.
