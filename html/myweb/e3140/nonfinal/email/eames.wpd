OK, bear in mind that I don't work for UD, so my information on some of this
will be limited, but here goes.

You can apply for a bulk installer on the UD website here
(https://www.ud.com/company/contact/support_installer.htm), by completing
all the necessary details. However, at present, I'm trying to find out what
sort of turrnaround there is on this, because the person who used to handle
these is currently not working for UD.

The current Cancer project was originally funded to last for a year, but we
have now gone beyond that since there is enough funding and data to take us
into next month. However, beyond that I can't say, I know that there are
discussions underway about continuing the project, but I don't know how
that's going. As for projects beyond that, there is nothing which has been
released by UD to say what is next, other than the fact they are trying to
line further projects up.

I would suggest that if you are putting a proposal together, you are careful
about mentioning any one particular project, since UD have also run research
other than Cancer (such as genetics and Anthrax), including some commercial
work to fund the other projects (although it is possible to opt _out_ of any
given project by changing a tick box on the website). I would suggest that
whilst you can mention the current work, you also point them in the
direction of the UD website(s), so that they can read it for themselves.

Hope some of that was of use,

Graham
