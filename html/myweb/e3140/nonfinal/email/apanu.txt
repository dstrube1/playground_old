I have been out of town and have not had a chance to read your proposal
yet .  Please check with me in about a week or so.  Thanks.

Dear Dr Panu,
I was wondering if you have had a chance to read through the proposal I
left in your mailbox shortly before the end of the summer semester. If
so,
any questions, comments or suggestions would be most welcome and
appreciated. :)
Thank you.
