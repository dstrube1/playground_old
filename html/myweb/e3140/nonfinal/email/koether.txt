Hello David,

  I found your proposal very easy to read and straight forward.  It
sounds intriguing. You did an exception job writing it.  I know the
College of Science and Mathematics is interested in biotechnology.

However, Kennesaw State University would probably want a monetary reward
for such an initiative and not pay you since they have the manpower to
do the work themselves. KSU is also low on funds due to the economic
down turn.

As most faculty store grades on their computers they probably would not
want to volunteer their computers for such initiatives either.  There
are plenty of computers in computer labs that could be used for this
initiative.

I am placing the proposal in Dr. Power's mailbox and she will see it
next week. She is the biochemist who might have a stronger desire to see
your proposal in action.

I wish you all the best in your initiative here.

Dr. Koether
