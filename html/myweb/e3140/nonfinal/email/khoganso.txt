David,

I made a quick pass through your proposal.  Nicely written organized, and thought out!

Two issues:  We are forming a bioinformatics program at KSU, who would be the most likely users of 
this technology.  [Comp Sci may use it for teaching/demonstrations, but less likely for research, 
since it is no longer a new idea from the computing point of view, but has been around for quite a 
few years].  My suggestion is that we establish a clear need for the technology before taking the 
next step.  I suggest that you speak with the person heading up the bioinformatics program (start 
with the biology dept chair) to see if they see a need for the technology, and are willing to push 
for it.  If biology/bioinformatics sees a need, I will also support the project, which will then 
need to be walked up the chain-of-command and over to Dr Randy Hinds, CIO at KSU.

Second issue:  we would need to include a thorough testing/monitoring phase on a subset of KSU's 
computers.  Dr Hinds has many responsibilities and demands on his shoulders.  It must be 
demonstrated, that adding this SW to the standard KSU installation, will not cause compatibility problems, 
or increase the maintenance effort.  I understand that it should not do either of those, but he 
will need a test on our own machines, in our own enviroment, before he could discuss any further 
roll-out.

Again, nice work!
Regards,
Dr. Hoganson

Here is the proposal I told you about in class:

Lemme know what you think.
Thanks
