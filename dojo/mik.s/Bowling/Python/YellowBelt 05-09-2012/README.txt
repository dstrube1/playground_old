To run the tests, ensure that Python is installed:

32-bit:  http://python.org/ftp/python/2.7.3/python-2.7.3.msi
64-bit:  http://python.org/ftp/python/2.7.3/python-2.7.3.amd64.msi

Add python.exe to your path if it's not there.

Then open a command prompt, navigate to the folder where this file lives,
and type the following command:

    python testscorer.py
