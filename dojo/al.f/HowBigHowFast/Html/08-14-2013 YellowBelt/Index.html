					<p>Roughly how many binary digits (bit) are required for the unsigned representation of:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>1,000</li>
						<li>1,000,000</li>
						<li>1,000,000,000</li>

					<p>2^10 is 1,024 or 10^3</p>
					<p>2^20 is 1,048,576 or 10^6</p>
					<p>So generally speaking, 2^X = 10^(X/10*3), or simply put, every 10 bits increases the representable size by about 1000.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>1,000 = <span class="final-answer">10 bits</span>.</li>
						<li>1,000,000 = <span class="final-answer">20 bits</span>.</li>
						<li>1,000,000,000 = <span class="final-answer">30 bits</span>.</li>
						<li>1,000,000,000,000 = <span class="final-answer">40 bits</span>.</li>
						<li>8,000,000,000,000 = <span class="final-answer">43 bits</span>. Every bit multiplies the total representation by 2. So 3 bits would multiply the size by 2^3 or 8.</li>

					<p>My town has approximately 20,000 residences. How much space is required to store the names, addresses, and a phone number for all of these (if we store them as characters)?</p>

					<p>A char in SQL is one byte. Number of chars per field: <p>

						<li>040: First Name</li>

					<p>I&#39;m storing 1,000,000 integers in a binary tree. Roughly how many nodes and levels can I expect the tree to have? Roughly how much space will it occupy on a 32-bit architecture?</p>
				</div>
				<div class="answer">
					<div class="A">A</div>
					<p>This is similar to the first question. There would be about <span class="final-answer">20 nodes</span> and about <span class="final-answer">5 levels</span> (log2(20)). Each node would hold a 4 byte integer and likely a 4 byte pointer (2 if bidirectional) to the next node. So the tree would roughly occupy <span class="final-answer">8 - 12 MB</span>.

					<p>My copy of Meyer&#39;s Object Oriented Software Construction has about 1,200 body pages. Assuming no flow control or protocol overhead, about how long would it take to send it over an async 56k baud modem line?</p>
				</div>
				<div class="answer">
					<div class="A">A</div>
					<p>56kbps is 7KB/s. Each page is about 3KB, so we can transfer about 2 pages per second. It would then take about 1200 pages / 2 = 600 seconds, or <span class="final-answer">10 minutes</span>.</p>

					<p>My binary search algorithm takes about 4.5mS to search a 10,000 entry array, and about 6mS to search 100,000 elements. How long would I expect it to take to search 10,000,000 elements (assuming I have sufficient memory to prevent paging).</p>
				</div>
				<div class="answer">
					<div class="A">A</div>
					<p>In a worst case scenario, to find the result: </p>
					<ul>
						<li>10,000 entries would be halved about 14 times in 4.5mS.</li>
						<li>100,000 entires would be halved about 17 times in 6 mS.</li>
						<li>10,000,000 entires would be halved about 23 times.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>That is around 3 operations per mS, so it would take about <span class="final-answer">7 mS</span> to run 23 operations.</p>

					<div class="Q">Q</div>
					<p>Unix passwords are stored using a one-way hash function: the original string is converted to the &#39;encrypted&#39; password string, which cannot be converted back to the original string. One way to attack the password file is to generate all possible cleartext passwords, applying the password hash to each in turn and checking to see if the result matches the password you&#39;re trying to crack. If the hashes match, then the string you used to generate the hash is the original password (or at least, it&#39;s as good as the original password as far as logging in is concerned). In our particular system, passwords can be up to 16 characters long, and there are 96 possible characters at each position. If it takes 1mS to generate the password hash, is this a viable approach to attacking a password?</p>
				</div>
				<div class="answer">
					<div class="A">A</div>
					<p>100 ^ 16 = 10 ^ 32. So it would take 10^30 seconds to crack the password worst case. <span class="final-answer">This would not be a viable approach.<span></p>
