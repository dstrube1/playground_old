An autohotkey script that replaces the function of ` when nothing else is held down to do without quotes
"{Delete}{Delete}{Delete}{Delete}\t"
(Basically it replaces 4 characters to the right of the text cursor with \t)

To run the AHK file, have to download and install Autohotkey from http://www.autohotkey.com and then run the AHK file

The EXE file is already compiled and does not require Autohotkey to be installed.

When the AHK or EXE is active, it shows up in the Windows Systray. To close the script, right click the icon in Systray and exit.
